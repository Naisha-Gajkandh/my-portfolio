# my-portfolio
a html + css website i design that shows my portfolio
The Structure of your Project should look like the Image i had attached in structure.png.
Their you would have the idea of how to make this project. The code i had already provided 
you can make minor change like changing my name and othe details with yours. In assets i had 
uploaded images of my choice that i want in my portfolio like background my profile photo and etc..
you can change that but  make sure the location is same, as the loaction is used in other html file code.
And also upload your resume file in assets in pdf form. I had provided most of the meaning of code 
and their functions through comments.You can have the outlook of my website in the folder website, it
consist of few images of the website 
Thank you, i hope it helps you.
